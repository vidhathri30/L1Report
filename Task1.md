## Task1

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm that determines the relationship between one dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x). It models a target prediction value based on the dependent variable, using this determined relationship. 

A linear regression line has the equation **Y=mX + b**

where Y is the dependent variable, m is the slope, X is the dependent variable and b is the y intercept. 

If there is more than one independent variable, the equation will be modified to 

**Y = m<sub>1</sub>X<sub></sub>1</sub> +</sub> m<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> + m<sub>3</sub>X<sub>3</sub> + â€¦ + b**

 **NumPy** supports large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these.
 
**Pandas** a software library written mainly for data manipulation and analysis purposes.

  **Scikit-learn** is a popular machine learning library with various classification, regression and clustering algorithms.
  
**Matplotlib** is a library that works as an extension of NumPy. It provides an API for embedding plots into applications.

The steps involved in implementing the model are as follows:

1.  Initially the libraries are imported

 2.  The California housing  price data is loaded from the datasets. The target contains the prices of the houses feature_names contain the names of all the features in the dataset (except target variables). Before moving on to the next step, the data is checked for any missing values i.e the null values. There are no missing values in the dataset

 4.  The data splitted as training data and testing data The size value 0.1 indicates that 90% of the samples are used to train the model and the remaining 10% to evaluate or test the model. For this purpose, we use we utilize the scikit learn library's train_test_split() function as shown

 5.  Scikit learn's LinearRegression() is used to train our model on both the training and test sets

 5.  This step is to determine whether the model is overfitting or not. Overfitted models perform well on test datasets but do not predict well on real-world datasets The root mean squared error(rms) and R2 score is used to assess the overfitting. The R2 score is of both training and testing data are almost equal to one. Hence the model is not overfitting.

6.Finally the actual prices vs predicted prices are visualized using scatter plot
