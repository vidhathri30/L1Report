## TASK 9

## Decision Trees

A decision tree is a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm, which is utilized for both classification and regression tasks. 
It has a hierarchical, tree structure, which consists of a root node, branches, internal nodes and leaf nodes.
The decisions or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions.
It is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure.
